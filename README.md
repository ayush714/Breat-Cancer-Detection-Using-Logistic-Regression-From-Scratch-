# Breat-Cancer-Detection-Using-Logistic-Regression-From-Scratch
This Repository is by me, Where I build a Breast Cancer Detection Using Logistic Regression From Scratch without using any libraries for training. And Also I explained each and every term, with the mathematical intution.  

I am also running a course "Full Stack ML Course" on My YT Channel Named "Newera" [ https//youtube.com/neweraa ], so for understanding logistic regression from very scratch and implementing in real world data. 

The theoretical understanding is given by me in the video also:- coming soon 

And Also There is one more ipynb file which is like assignment. 

Soon, More Notebooks based on this will be there.
